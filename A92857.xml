            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Queſt. <hi>What door is in this place meant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol. A door (properly)</hi> is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into, and a paſſage out of an houſe, ſuch was the door at which <hi>Peter</hi> knockt, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 13.</p>
               <p>But Metaphorically. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſometimes</p>
               <p n="1">1. To <hi>Christ,</hi> Joh. 10. 1. <hi>I am</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Oſtium Vitae.</note> 
                  <hi>the door.</hi> Heaven is our Palace, Chriſt Jeſus is the doore, his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are the key to open it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> Acts 14. 27. <hi>God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Oſtium Gratiae.</note> 
                  <hi>hath opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles:</hi> By the Goſpel there is a mutual paſſage made for Chriſt to enter into us, and for us to enter into Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To <hi>the heart of man:</hi> As in <note place="margin">Oſtium Animae.</note> this place: Now this door is in

different reſpects, an <hi>open doore,</hi> and a <hi>ſhut door.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In reſpect of ſinne and Satan, This door ſtill ſtands open; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts freely come out, and ſinful ſuggeſtions freely come in at it.</p>
               <p>But in reſpect of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> It is a <hi>ſhut door</hi> lockt up by <hi>ignorance,</hi> and barred up by hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and <hi>infidelity:</hi> ſo that conſider any man in his meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural condition, Chriſt is not within him, but without him: He is not a <hi>gueſt,</hi> but a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> the door is ſhut againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, Three things are meant by them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſts willingneſſe to do a ſinner good;</hi> to have entrance, to be admitted. Chriſt is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more willing to come to thee, then thou art to come to Chriſt: He is at the doore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170259:18"/>
before e're you think of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſts earneſt deſire,</hi> his active paines with a ſinful ſoule. He doth not only come to the door, but <hi>knocks at the door,</hi> ſo that oft-times he breaks open the doore; coming and calling will not be heard, and therefore he knocks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſts patient expectation of a ſinners opening.</hi> He doth not come and go away preſently; Nor ask, and go away preſently; nor call, and go away preſently; no, nor knock, and go away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; But he <hi>ſtands and knocks:</hi> His <hi>ſtanding at the door</hi> notes his continuing patience, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſtudy of our ſalvation; his <hi>knocking,</hi> notes his earneſt importunity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. What the knocking at the door implies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> In the general, it is ſome <hi>preventing, previous, evengelical,</hi> and <hi>potent work of Chriſt</hi> towards and upon a ſinner, making way
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170259:19"/>
for his gracious entrance, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into to the ſoul.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There are five things in the Text, and from the precedent part of this Epiſtle to the <hi>Church of Laodicea,</hi> which plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the truth of the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If you obſerve firſt the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the perſons,</hi> at whoſe doors Chriſt did ſtand and knock.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They were a meer formal people, there was little or no power of godlineſs at all in them <hi>(ver. 15. Thou art neither hot nor cold)</hi> A company of meer hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, or at leaſt of formal profeſſors.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:170259:23"/>2. They were a proudly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited people <hi>(verſ. 17. Thou ſayeſt I am rich, and increaſed with goods, and have need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They were (in reſpect of all ſpirituals) a moſt deſtitute peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: not a doit of goodneſſe, nor any one ragge of grace; nor good in any one part, (ver. 19. <hi>Thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blinde, and naked.</hi> They could bring nothing at all to Chriſt, there was not any one thing conſiderable in them; nay, every thing which might raiſe diſtaſte and diſregard.) And all this miſerable condition, was the more miſerable, becauſe they were thus miſerable and knew it not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They were ſo provokingly ſinful, that Chriſts ſtomack had much ado to beare with them. He could hardly forbear to <hi>ſpew them out of his mouth,</hi> (verſe 16.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170259:23"/>Yet at their doores does Chriſt ſtand and knock, He begs at the doore of beggers, mercy begs to miſery, happineſs begs to wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, riches begs to poverty, light begs to blindneſſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency begs to nakedneſſe, and beſeeches thoſe poor and miſerable ſinners to take <hi>gold</hi> from him, thoſe <hi>naked</hi> ſinners to take <hi>rayment</hi> from him, and thoſe <hi>blinde</hi> ſinners to take <hi>oyntment</hi> from him, <hi>(v.</hi> 18.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you conſider the <hi>motions of Chriſt towards them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In the <hi>order of motion:</hi> one would think that the poor ſhould have come to the rich mans door, &amp; the ſick man have come or ſent for the Phyſician; but behold! here the rich man comes to the poor mans door, and the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian comes to the ſick mans houſe. They came not <hi>firſt to Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> came firſt to them. Chriſt came not only to <hi>ſave,</hi> but alſo to <hi>ſeek that which was l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt prevents ſinners with his kindneſſe, and with their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In the degrees of motion,</hi> he <hi>comes to the door,</hi> and then he <hi>calls at the doore:</hi> (verſe 18. <hi>I councel thee to buy of me gold tryed in the fire)</hi> and then <hi>he ſtands;</hi> (He doth not take every ſilence, nor every neglect of offer for an anſwer) and then he knocks at the doore by ſome louder and ſtronger operation of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and all this is, that they would once hearken and open the door unto him, that he might enter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you conſider the eaſineſs of the termes upon which he would be theirs, as low as poſſibly <note place="margin">Termes not of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority but of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> could be; do but open the door and I will enter, and I will be yours. You know that in an ordinary way there can be no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in till the doores be opened: Chriſt ſtands upon <hi>nothing with a ſinners</hi> but this—open thy heart

Even the greateſt ſinner amongſt you, ſhall enjoy the ſweeteſt Saviour; If he will but open the door, let him but give me entrance, and I will give him ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you conſider the <hi>ſweetneſs of his perſwading and alluring Arguments:</hi> (let me but come in, and <hi>I will ſup with him,</hi> and he <hi>ſhall ſup with me.) Zacheus</hi> did let in Chriſt, and ſalvation

came thereby unto him: Chriſt will be a <hi>feaſt</hi> whereſoever he comes: If we let him in by faith, he will bring all ſpiritual life and peace and comfort with him: <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come one day to <hi>Judge,</hi> but now he comes to <hi>ſave ſinners.</hi> Beſides this evidence from the Text, there are divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which teſtifie that Chriſt is exceeding willing to come in and ſave ſinners.

               <p>O ſtrive to beleeve that Chriſt is willing to ſave a broken ſinner: and to help you in this conſider four things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>door of a broken heart</hi> is the <hi>great doore at which Chriſt knocks.</hi> He calls to ſuch a ſinner
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170259:32"/>
by name, come unto me: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he calls thee: open thy door for a <hi>broken Saviour,</hi> O thou <hi>broken hearted ſinner!</hi> let me but come in, and I have oyle to ſupple thoſe ſores of yours, and I have balme to cure thoſe wounds of yours, and I have blood, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and mercies to anſwer for thoſe ſins of yours; and I have a ſpirit to cleanſe and beautifie that ſoul of yours, you cannot need the thing which I have not, nor deſire the good which I will not freely give unto you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath broken through many of your doors already,</hi> to finde you out and to get with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you: He hath broken through the <hi>door of your ignorance,</hi> and through the <hi>door of your ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſſe,</hi> and through the <hi>door of your conſciences,</hi> there is but one doore left, the <hi>door of your will;</hi> If you be but willing to take him, he ſtands upon no more.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:170259:32"/>3. The more able you are to <hi>beleeve that Chriſt is willing to enter your hearts, the more willing your hearts will be to open unto Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, all that the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſoul urgeth (if it be ſtrictly obſerved) is the queſtioning of Chriſts willingneſſe to ſave it; All thoſe objections of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnings, of want of deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er humblings, and want of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, of long reſiſtances, of the variety of ſinnings, of utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe, &amp;c.

               <p>Now why doeſt thou ſtick at this? For,</p>
               <p>If he be willing to ſave any, it is to ſave ſinners, and he never ſaved any but a ſinner, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſinner, was therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: Muſt not Chriſt ſave becauſe we deſerve not to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?

               <p n="3">3. The <hi>conſciences of men,</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt them that they will not let in any power of Jeſus

and breadth of the love of God towards us in Chriſt; make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the pearle, and ſlight the bread of life, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any light breaks in upon the minde, yet the <hi>judgement of the ſinner likes not Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:</hi> what, ſaith he, and muſt I</p>

               <p>Nay verily, if Chriſt thinks that I want Reaſon, and know not what is good for one; or ſees not when I am well, if he will not come in and take part with the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170259:46"/>
world, and with an infirmity too, and with a little liberty, I muſt be pardoned if I keep houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>O Chriſtians, there are three chaines which hold the ſinner that he will not open the doore to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The chain of <hi>ſinful pleaſures,</hi> this held the <hi>young man,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The chaine of <hi>ſinful profits,</hi> this held the <hi>young man in the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The chain of <hi>ſelf eaſe.</hi> Theſe will hold thee till thou art bound up in chains of everlaſting dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, unleſs God be the more merciful to thee.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the things which make men either totally to ſtand out, or onely Hypocritically (in a fit) to pretend that they will open unto Chriſt; the love of a ſinne makes them ſhut the door again, and ſo doth the love of the world, and the love of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170259:47"/>
their eaſe, and liberty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>proud and irrational per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſſe of the will,</hi> this is many times a ſpecial cauſe why Chriſt is made to ſtand long and knock.</p>
               <p>Either men <hi>will not</hi> (after all) <hi>be perſwaded:</hi> Though their judgements be diſarmed of all carnal cavils and objections, though they be convinced of that infinite happineſſe in Jeſus Chriſt, yet they cannot abide the holineſſe of Chriſt, they will not hearken: As they anſwered in the Parable <hi>we will not come,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>ye will not come to me, ye would not, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or they <hi>will capitulate with Chriſt,</hi> to enter in their way and manner, unto which Chriſt will never yeild: For inſtance, they will open and receive Chriſt,</p>
               <p>If they may finde ſome <hi>holy change</hi> in their hearts firſt, or</p>
               <p>If they might finde ſome

                  <hi>worthineſſe</hi> in themſelves, or</p>
               <p>If they they might have ſome <hi>Aſſurance</hi> that their ſinnes were pardoned, and they <hi>stood in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God,</hi> and were in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or</p>
               <p>If they might have him come <hi>in juſt at that time as they pleaſe,</hi> in the deſires of mercy, or</p>
               <p>If they might have ſuch <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his grace and love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Chriſtian, what doeſt thou meane to make and <hi>impoſe articles</hi> on thy Chriſt, who alone is to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe articles</hi> unto thee; why doeſt thou require that of, and in thy ſelf, which Chriſt (when he comes at firſt to enter the ſoule) never required of it. Theſe are after works, and not previous conditions, thy work is only to open the doore, and it is then Chriſts work to furniſh the houſe; let him but in, and let him alone to bring with him mercy to thee, grace to ſanctifie, aſſurance to comfort and eaſe thee.</p>

                  <hi>With thy friend?</hi> what man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> you, if his friend came to the door and was importunate, would he not ariſe and open the door? as Chriſt ſpake.</p>
               <p>Or with <hi>a beggar,</hi> who knocks and is importunate: would ye not riſe and open and give him an almes? will you open the doors to a beggar, and not to a Saviour? to one who may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an almes of bounty from you, and not to a Chriſt from whom your ſelves may receive the almes of everlaſting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?</p>
               <p>Or with <hi>thy dog,</hi> that ſtands without and cries to come in: Ah Lord, will you open your doors to a dogge, and not to Chriſt!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:170259:48"/>Or with the <hi>devil,</hi> who no ſooner calls, but you heare, he is opened unto before he knocks: will you open the doore to let in hell, and will you not open the doore to let in heaven? will you open the door to ſinne and death, and not to Chriſt and life? Can you ſhew a more baſe diſeſteeme of Jeſus Chriſt. Why, what is Chriſt? and what is the Sonne of God? and what would you have that you deal thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily with him, and ſhut him out of your doors?</p>
               <p>Whether you hold out Chriſt by, 1. Ignorance. 2. Or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance. 3. Or by diffidence, 4. Or by impenitence, yet you and Chriſt are ſtill aſunder, you are Chriſtleſſe, and evangelical offers, though excellent, yet are tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. <note place="margin">Rara hora Brevis mora.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>deſparate hazard you run;</hi> in the midſt of all evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical knockings; what if death ſhould knock at your doors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170259:49"/>

               <p>Or what if Chriſt will go away from thy door, and never ſtand there, or knock there any longer? It was one of the greateſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that ever God ſhewd to thee, that Jeſus Chriſt would conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to come, and ſtand, and knock at thy doores, and it will prove the heavieſt judgement that ever befel ſinners; if he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly departs from thee becauſe thou wilt not open thy doors unto him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your <hi>holding out Chriſt thus long will coſt you dear,</hi> though at length you do open to him, as it will coſt you hell if you never open to him.

               </p>
               <p>Beloved! the Lord is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all his wayes, and wiſe too in the proportionate retributions of ſinners: we may ſee our ſinnes in the very judgements and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God.

We have ſhut out his Son, and he ſhuts out our ſuits; we have made Chriſt to wait long, and we now
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170259:50"/>
are made to expect long. We did not ariſe to the knockings of Chriſt, and he will not now ariſe to the knockings and calls of our diſtreſſes. We think it much that God comes not down all this while to deliver us from the blood of warre; and God hath thought it much that we would not come down to open the doors, and to accept of the blood of his Sonne. We have made our God and Chriſt to waite upon us with ſpiritual deliverances; Is it not righteous that we ſhould wait upon him for temporal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances? O that we could ſtop our mouths, and ſilence and check our impatient and murmuring hearts this day! Remember, ſaith God, how ye have dealt with my Chriſt, with my Spirit, with my Goſpel, with my Offers of grace and ſalvation.</p>

               <p>That ſomething muſt be done on our part, as well as ſomething on Chriſts part; though Chriſt be willing to ſave a ſinner, yet he will not ſave him againſt his will. 'Tis true, this willingneſſe to open unto Chriſt is not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, but a ſupernatural effect, it is <hi>voluntas mota,</hi> nay <hi>mutata,</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> rightly ſpeaks) yet it it muſt be, or elſe there can be no converſion, no ſalvation of us.</p>
               <p>Againe, they are expreſſed in an indefinite way as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional: Not if this or that man; but <hi>if any man, &amp;c.</hi> To note</p>
               <p>That there is a latitude, a full
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170259:54"/>
latitude in the offer of Chriſt and grace: No ſinner (under the Goſpel) is excluded by Chriſt, but by himſelf. Although the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt</hi> be definite and particular, yet the <hi>proclamation</hi> is indefinite and general: Favours (ſay the Lawyers)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Now the condition of Chriſts entrance, is only this, <hi>If any man hear my voice and open the doore:</hi> The <hi>hearing</hi> anſwers to his <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling,</hi> in <hi>verſe</hi> 18. and the <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwers to his knocking</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 20. Both of them united make up (if I miſtake not) that which we call beleeving, which comes by hearing, and is in it ſelf the eare of the ſoul to hearken, and the key of the ſoul to open unto Chriſt: But of this more anon; In the mean time there are two very remarkable propoſitions from the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the door of a ſinners heart ought to open unto Chriſts
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170259:55"/>
calling and knocking.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That whatſoever the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition of any ſinner hath been, and whatſoever his preſent condition is, yet if he opens to Chriſt, Chriſt will be his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct. 1. That the doore of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners heart ought to open unto Chriſt calling and knocking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I explicate this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, let me premiſe a diſtinction or two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt diſtiguiſh 'twixt <hi>officium</hi> and <hi>principium:</hi> I do not ſay that the ſinner can open his door to Chriſt but that he ought to open it: the <hi>ability</hi> is one thing, the <hi>duty</hi> is another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Although it be true, that in converſion, the ſinner doth actually open the door to Chriſt, yet you muſt diſtinguiſh 'twixt what he doth <hi>virtute innata,</hi> and what he doth <hi>virtute illata:</hi> by a power of his own, and by a power given unto him: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer we deny, the latter we grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:170259:55"/>Theſe things being premiſed I ſhall now diſcuſſe three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What door of a ſinner that is which muſt be opened.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What the opening of that door is, and how farre it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why that door muſt be opened, ſince Chriſt is able by his omnipotency to come into the ſoul of a ſinner without his open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt. 1. What door of a ſinner that is which muſt be opened unto Chriſt calling and knocking?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The door in the general is the <hi>whole ſoul of man:</hi> The ſoul of man is the <hi>houſe</hi> in which Chriſt deſires to dwell: And it is <note place="margin">It is the door at which and for which Chriſt knocks.</note> the door too thorow which Chriſt intends to enter, although ſome other Lord hath got poſſeſſion, yet the ſoul belongs only to Chriſt, as by right of <hi>creation,</hi> (for he made it) ſo alſo by <hi>right of Redemption,</hi> (for he hath
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170259:56"/>
bought and purchaſed it.)</p>
               <p>But principally there are two noble faculties of the ſoul, which (I humbly conceive) make up this door.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The judgement of a ſinner:</hi> at this part of the door ſtands the <hi>Goſpel, in the truth of it, (this is a true ſaying, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>will of a ſinner:</hi> at this part of the door ſtands the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> in the <hi>goodneſſe of it.</hi> This is a true ſaying, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners (this is for the underſtanding) and is worthy of all acceptation, (here is goodneſſe,) and properly reſpects the will of a ſinner. So that whatſoever the Goſpel holds forth concerning Chriſt, It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents all of it to theſe doors, and theſe two faculties may and can reach (either by way of percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> or by way of <hi>receiving</hi> in the <hi>will)</hi> the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170259:56"/>
whole ſumme of Evangelical ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>And in truth, al the commerce or trading (if I may ſo ſpeak) which Chriſt hath with a ſinner, or that a ſinner hath with Chriſt, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally and primarily at theſe doors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. But the next queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more difficult, <hi>What the opening of the door is, and how far it extends?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer by parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and judgement of a ſinner,</hi> the door is opening when three things are wrought.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>An evangelical apprehenſion,</hi> not only of our neceſſity of Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo of his excellency, deſignation, qualification, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and willingneſſe to ſave ſinners.</p>
               <p>When ſo much ſpiritual light is let in, as that a ſinner diſcerns <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a <hi>Saviour,</hi> that <hi>God hath ſet him forth,</hi> and <hi>ſent him</hi> to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170259:57"/>
be ſo, and that he hath accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the full work of our Redemption, and that a ſinner is capable of him and it; yea and the ſoul gives credence hereto: Now the <hi>key</hi> (if I may ſo expreſs my ſelf) <hi>is put into the door.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſingular appreciation of this Jeſus Christ,</hi> ſo that now he ſtands as it were in his glory and beauty before the eyes of a poor ſinner, like the Sunne dazling and drowning all the Stars.

               <p>And <hi>Chriſt alone</hi> is eſteemed by the poor humbled ſinner, as the <hi>ſuperlative excellency, the chiefeſt of ten thouſands,</hi> the royal ſignet of divine love, the onely deſirable of my ſoul, the peculiar remedy of my miſery, the abſolute center of my everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, and the moſt attractive Adamant or

               <p n="4">4. When the door of the will rightly opens to Chriſt, <hi>It comes off with the concomitant attendance of the whol ſoul:</hi> the whole ſoul ſtands open to look on ChriſT, to admire Chriſt, to welcome Chriſt.

Yea all the affections open themſelves and come forth (as it were) to let in and welcome
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170259:61"/>
Chriſt. <hi>Love</hi> comes forth and ſaith, welcome Chriſt, thou art the bridgroom of my ſoul. <hi>Deſire</hi> comes forth, and ſaith welcome Chriſt, thou art the ſatisfaction of my ſoul. <hi>Delight</hi> comes forth, and ſaith welcome Chriſt, thou art the paradiſe of my ſoul. <hi>Hope</hi> comes forth, and ſaith welcome Chriſt, thou haſt been the long looked for of my ſoule. <hi>Joy</hi> comes forth, and ſaith, welcome Chriſt, thou art the centre and reſt of my ſoule. <hi>Grief</hi> comes forth, and ſaith welcome Chriſt, I am offended and exceedingly troubled, becauſe I have dealt ſo unkindly with a gracious Chriſt. <hi>Anger</hi> comes forth, and ſaith, welcome Chriſt, I am vexed at the very heart, that for poor and baſe things I ſhould all this while keep out my bleſſed Chriſt. <hi>Hatred</hi> comes forth, and ſaith, welcome Chriſt, I proteſt I will never have any peace, nor yeild ſervice, but will do my beſt to

deſtroy all theſe ſinful Luſts, the enemies of Chriſt And <hi>fear</hi> comes forth and ſaith, welcome Chriſt; I owe thee all reverence, and will watch the ſoul that it ſhall never willingly grieve Chriſt more. And <hi>zeal</hi> comes forth and ſaith, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſt, I will do the more for thee, becauſe I have done ſo much againſt thee: I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do any thing for thee, who haſt done every thing for me: thou didſt not ſpare thy blood to ſave my ſoul, and I will not ſpare my life to ſerve thine honour: And now (ſirs) when the ſoul is thus formed and framed by faith, (when the judgement thus comes off to Chriſt, and the will thus comes off to Chriſt) then is the <hi>door</hi> (at which Chriſt hath knockt) <hi>truly and fully open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Why that door muſt be opened to Chriſt, when Chriſt is able by his omnipotency (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our opening) to enter into the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170259:62"/>
heart of any ſinner?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> That you may have a more clear and diſtinct reſolution of this enquiry, premiſe a few things with me.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In matters of this nature, it is not ſafe to inſiſt on the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of Chriſt,</hi> but we muſt rather reſpect his <hi>ordinate power,</hi> if I may ſo expreſſe my ſelf; Chriſt is (in reſpect of his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power) as able to damne us as to ſave us; to throw us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hel, as well as draw us up to heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Although the doore muſt be opened, yet this is done by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an <hi>omnipotent act</hi> from <hi>Chriſt too</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt declares his Almighty power.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the creation of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the converſion of ſinners.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the reſurrection of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170259:63"/>
dead. To quicken a dead ſinner, to make him a beleever, declares as great power as to give a new <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 19, 20.</note> being.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet thirdly, Chriſt will not ſo act his omnipotency in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners converſion, as to exclude the heart of a ſinner from opening to him, but will make the heart of a ſinner willing to open to him; Becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt intends in this work a conjugal union 'twixt himſelf and the ſoul of a ſinner,</hi> unto which <hi>a mutual conſent of will is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſome other kinds of union, this is not neceſſary, but unto a match or marriage it is: Chriſts Will, and our will reciprocally meeting make it up.</p>
               <p>I do confeſſe that all the offers of Chriſt are precious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unſpeakable readineſſe or <hi>willingneſſe on his part,</hi> but there muſt be alſo conſent, and <hi>an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance on our part,</hi> or elſe no
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170259:63"/>
ſaving will come to us. For it is not ſalvation only purchaſed, or onely offered, which actually ſaves a ſinner, it muſt be ſalvation alſo embraced and accepted, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt in this converting work,</hi> principally aimes at <hi>the glorifying of his grace and rich love,</hi> and mercy, and therefore he carries it on by ſuch wayes, and ſteps wherein the ſoul may take notice of them. When he did <hi>create man,</hi> this he did without any more ado, by a ſole <hi>word</hi> of <hi>power,</hi> which then he intended to magnifie. But when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts a ſinner, now he orders eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act and paſſage, ſo that the ſinner ſhall ſubſcribe <hi>all the glory to his free grace and great love.</hi> Now he muſt ſee his loſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without Chriſt, now he muſt ſee the travels and ſufferings of Chriſt, to redeem and ſave him; now he muſt ſee the tender care of Chriſt, and vehement deſire
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170259:64"/>
to beſtow himſelf, and purchaſe on him; Now he muſt ſee the glories and riches of Chriſt, to perſwade and draw him; Now he muſt ſee the free bounty of Chriſt, in inſiſting on no condition but this, open unto me, and be but willing to let me in. Now he muſt ſee, that nothing in himſelfe can be ſalvation unto him; the heart muſt open to Chriſt, or elſe it muſt periſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Christ will have the ſinner to eſteeme him a moſt valuable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> and to let him in as one that is worthy: Meer power (whether we will or no) may ſet up it ſelf, whether we think the perſon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or not; But Chriſt will come in rather upon choiſe; His <hi>worth</hi> ſhall make as much way for him as his <hi>power,</hi> the ſinner ſhall ſay, it is better to let in Chriſt, then to keep out Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The work is done if this door be opened;</hi> Chriſt ſtands upon no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170259:64"/>Nothing is done by us, if the will comes no off to Chriſt: All the knowledge which a man hath, and all the troubles which a man feels, and all the duties which a man performes, and all the good words which a man ſpeaks, they are all as nothing, they alter not the condition; The condition is ſtill Chriſtleſſe till the will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to let in Chriſt: But all comes off, the work is done if the will comes off and opens to Chriſt; Chriſt hath got what he would have, he hath got the ſtrong caſtle, he hath now won all; for all the ſoul ſtands or falls with the will, holds out or comes in with the will. The whole man is at the obedience of his will and if that be now at the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, Chriſt hath got all.</p>

to the commands of Chriſt, &amp; the holineſs of Chriſt, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt, that it is of al things under heaven, the moſt difficult to be willing to open to Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Though his humblings be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmall, yet if he will open to Chriſt, Chriſt will be his.</hi> It is true, that humblings (for ought I know) are a neceſſary antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent before the opening of the heart to Chriſt. The <hi>ſtinging Serpent</hi> was felt before the <hi>healing Serpent</hi> was lookt on: The ground is plowed before it is ſowen; The breaking hammer of the Law ſtrikes the conſcience, before the golden key of the Goſpel opens the will. But as Chriſt enters not after the greateſt humblings in conſcience, if the will opens not to him, ſo he will enter into
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170259:78"/>
the leaſt humblings in the ſoul, if the will therefore opens to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</p>
               <p>Humblings may be conſidered two ways.</p>

And when this is attained (whether by more or by leſſer ſtroaks,) Chriſts feet are ſtepping into the ſoule preſently.</p>
               <p>May I ſpeak a ſtrange truth; If it were poſſible for a ſoule to be willing to be open unto Chriſt, without any one laſh or touch of antecedent trouble, or bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Jeſus Chriſt would forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with cloſe with it.</p>
               <p>If the iron would bow and be pliable without fire or ſtroak, the impreſſion might, and would be made upon it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:170259:78"/>If the wood did cleave without a ſtroke, it were well enough, or if it doth with one ſtroke, that without the addition of any more ſufficeth.</p>
               <p>If there accompanies ſuch an efficacy, the leaſt ſenſe of ſinne, and the loweſt ſmiting for ſinne, that the will is truly turned off from it, and turned up to Chriſt, it is enough; though thou trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt thy ſelf with more, yet Chriſt expects no more, the door is open and he will enter. <hi>Lydia</hi>'s <hi>heart</hi> was touched, and preſently opened: The <hi>Jews</hi> were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cryed out, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> upon hearing the firſt part of <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, and were opened to receive Chriſt, and they enjoyed him, upon the hearing of the next part of the Sermon at the ſame time.

The Prodigal childe was willing to come <hi>to his Fathers houſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? did he plead his good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, did he plead his worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? O no, <hi>I am not worthy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be called thy Sonne;</hi> and yet becauſe that doore of his heart was opened, the door of his fathers affection was alſo opened;

                  <hi>He fell on his neck and embraced him, and received him joyfully,</hi> Luke 15. 21.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>One is <hi>Legal</hi> or <hi>Perſonal:</hi> O if you look for this, if you ſtand upon this, you will never open the door to Chriſt: The full ſoul deſpiſeth the honey comb, the ſelf-juſtifying Phariſee went home unjuſtified: you muſt be loſt in your own eyes, you muſt be nothing in your own eyes, you muſt be poor in Spirit, you muſt ſee your lives, and hopes, and helps to lie in the hands of meer mercy, or elſe you will never open to Chriſt, and Chriſt will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into you.</p>
               <p>Another is <hi>Evangelical</hi> or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective. As the Father once ſpake: <hi>Domine! Merita meaſunt miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia tua:</hi> ſo muſt the ſinner ſay, O bleſſed Chriſt, my worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is onely in thy worthineſſe. Although I am not worthy that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170259:80"/>
thou ſhouldeſt enter into my heart, yet thou art worthy that my heart ſhould be opened unto thee. This is the worthineſſe, and none other but this that Chriſt inſiſts upon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though <hi>holineſſe be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanting, yet if the ſinner will open unto Chriſt, Chriſt will be his.</hi> I do confeſſe that if Chriſt ſtood with a ſinner upon theſe tearms, holy you muſt be, and holy you muſt make your ſelfe to be ere I will cloſe with you; I muſt ſee every room furniſhed with grace before I will come in to you, then I am confident that no fleſh living ſhall be ſaved: For it is as impoſſible for a ſinner to ſanctifie and renue himſelf, as it is for a dead man to quicken him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But Chriſt ſtands not on that, he knows that the ſinner is an empty cask, that no good dwells in him, that he lies in his blood, that all his beautifying or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments are from above, all to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170259:80"/>
be found and taken out of his ward-robe; That it is his work to refine, and ſanctifie, as well as to pardon and juſtifie, all that the humble ſoul muſt bring, is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; as the beggar needs bring nothing but a hand to receive; and for holineſſe, which thou complaineſt is wanting, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening ſoul muſt expect that from Chriſt; who brings this to the ſinner, not the ſinner to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>By all which it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that nothing ſhall hinder the ſinner, any ſinner, if he be once willing to open to Chriſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why is it that Chriſt deals thus? that any ſinner (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever his condition and courſe hath been) may yet have him, if he will but open unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol</hi> The Reaſons are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt is made ours only by beleeving:</hi> This is that which immediately, and fully draws up <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 16.</note>

the match 'twixt a ſoule and Chriſt, and faith excludes no ſinner: If any ſinner can beleeve he ſhall have Chriſt. Indeed if Chriſt did offer himſelf to be ours upon the legal condition of inherent perfection; (habitual and actual) then every prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tranſgreſſion, and every preſent defect or want of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, would have rendred us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of his perſon and union. The Law receives no ſinner to mercy. But becauſe he tenders himſelf onely upon beleeving, now no ſinner is pre-judged, the way is open and free to any one. Chriſt doth not deal with us at all (in this opening work) but as abſolute ſinners; nor doth faith (herein) deal with Chriſt, but as with an abſolute Saviour: He knows that we are caſt by the Law, and therefore addreſſes himſelf to us in the way of the New Covenant, which requires nothing in the world from us,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170259:81"/>
but onely beleeve, onely come, onely open to me. The leaſt ſinner cannot have Chriſt any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and the greateſt ſinner may enjoy him upon theſe termes.</p>

Indeed he took upon him our ſinnes, but there was no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of ours, which he could or did bear: All our ſins were charged on, and he alone went through the work of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for them, and without any concurrent dignity of ours, did he accompliſh our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and reconciliation.

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. The laſt Uſe ſhall be for <hi>direction:</hi> for me thinks ſome ſoul is touched and wrought upon this day, and ſecretly crys
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170259:90"/>
out, O what ſhall we do? what courſe may we take, that our hearts may be made willing to open unto Chriſt, and to let him in.</p>
               <p>The helpful directions which I would preſcribe, are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>minde muſt be opened</hi> if ever you would get your wills to be opened: I may here aptly make uſe of that ſcholaſtical diſtinction of <hi>neceſſitas conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> and of <hi>neceſſitas conſequentis:</hi> Although there be not a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſequence, that if the minde be enlightned, then the will is opened, yet there is a neceſſity of conſequent, for the will cannot be opened, unleſſe the minde be firſt enlightened. For there is neither any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>object,</hi> for the will to tend to, nor any motive to affect and draw the will, till light diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and apprehends them: Now this light or knowledge in the minde, which is repreſentative
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170259:90"/>
and affective, muſt be twofold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reflexive,</hi> that you are ſinful and loſt, and ſtand in need of mercy and ſalvation, more then the moſt pining beggar doth of a bit of bread to ſave his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Direct,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt is by God the Father ſet forth to be a Saviour, and that this is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſutable to your condition, and poſſible for your fruition. <hi>A ſenſe of miſery,</hi> and then an <hi>apprehenſion of a good</hi> every way helpful, and of which one may be capable, is neceſſarily apt to draw and incline the will: If there were a good, but then it is of another kinde, and anſwered not my neceſſity; or if it did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer my neceſſity, but then there were an impoſſibility for me to obtain it. It would not ſtirre the will at all; Therefore ſtrive for ſuch a knowledge as diſcovers your ſoules to be loſt, and onely reparable by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:170259:91"/>
4 10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith unto thee, give me drink, thou wouldeſt have asked of him, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>judgement muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,</hi> if you would have your wills opened: <hi>A light</hi> meerly <hi>apprehenſive,</hi> is nothing ſo work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the will, as that which is <hi>diſcurſive:</hi> A ſudden carrying of a candle through the roome enables us not to ſo full a ſurvey as if you ſtood a while with it and ſeriouſly beheld the objects: A double work of judgement is neceſſary to affect the will to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>One is <hi>conſiderative,</hi> which is a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rious and full weighing of the ſoules condition as wanting Chriſt, or as enjoying of him; I am but a dead man if I refuſe Chriſt; If I embrace him, I am bleſſed, in the one ſcale is eternal miſery, in the other ſcale is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity, upon the turning of either, is the turning of my ſoul,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170259:91"/>
my precious ſoul. If I will not open to Chriſt upon his own conditions, my ſoul is loſt, (O my ſoul, what loſſe is the loſſe of a ſoul?) If my heart be willing to open, my ſoul is ſaved; (O the mercy, the grace, the peace, the life, the heaven in that one word!)</p>
               <p>Suppoſe I keep my ſins and hold faſt the world, and let go the offer of Chriſt, where is the gain, what is the ſafety, whence is the comfort by this, what will be the iſſue? Suppoſe I open to Chriſt, and let go my ſinnes, and part with the world, what is my loſſe? where is my diminution? can happineſſe impoveriſh me? can alſufficiency be loſſe to me? can ſalvation diſtreſſe me? If I be not a ſinner, why do I talk of a Saviour? if I be, why do I not receive an offered Saviour? If I be a ſinner, do not I need a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? If it be a tender mercy to offer, is it more then a wiſe duty
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170259:92"/>
to embrace him? if my body were drowning, I would catch hold of a rock; If my ſoule be ſinking, why ſhould I not lay hold of a Chriſt? I may periſh if I will, (O but who would periſh wilfully? who would periſh at all?) &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Another is <hi>Argumentative,</hi> which conſiſts in a divine reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either diſproving the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the ſoul againſt a cloſing with Chriſt, or enforcing and edging thoſe arguments drawn from free grace, from Chriſt, from the New Covenant, which tends to encline the will unto him: There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e many feares, and doubts, and jealouſies, rowling (eſpecially) in a convinced and humbled ſpirit, queſtioning ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Chriſts ſufficiency, or elſe his intention and willingneſſe; ſometimes our own capacity, by reaſon of greatneſſe of ſinning, or pecularity of former refuſals, all which you ſhould do well to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170259:92"/>
get reſolved and cleared, that ſo you may ſee the way ſtanding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and free for ſuch a ſinner (as you judge your ſelf to be) to come in, and be embraced by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith muſt be obtained</hi> if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you would get your hearts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; for when all Arguments are anſwered, yet the will will not come off without a ſupernatural quality to enable and draw it: There muſt be a new quality in the will, as well as a new light in the minde; for the will cannot execute a ſupernatural act, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſupernatural qualification. When you put another bias on the Bowle, this will draw it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way; what is the reaſon one needle ſtarts up to the pole-ſtar, and another doth not? One is toucht with the Load-ſtone, and the other is not, <hi>Surgunt indocti</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtine) &amp; capiunt coelum, &amp;c.</hi> the unlearned riſe up and take heaven, and many

that are learned do not: <hi>poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (in reſpect of parts as well as in reſpect of eſtate) <hi>receive the Goſpel,</hi> and the wiſe men of the world ſlight it. Surely the reaſon is this, becauſe God gives knowledge onely to the one, but he gives faith to the other; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſee the worth of Chriſt, nor bow the will unto him but faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Goſpel muſt be heard,</hi> for this can work that faith which opens the will, <hi>Fidas ex auditu,</hi> Rom. 10. 17. <hi>Lydia heard Paul preaching,</hi> and the <hi>Lord opened her heart,</hi> Acts 16. 14. ſo did the <hi>Jaylor</hi> in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and his heart was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, <hi>importunate prayer</hi> muſt be uſed: the Goſpel (we ſay) is the key of the Spirit, and prayer (we ſay) is the key of heaven; and truly if it can open the eares of a God, it may quickly ſerve to open the

               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, for anſwer to the queſtion we muſt know, that there is a double poſſeſſion that Chriſt hath of ſouls.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Poſſeſſio juris</hi> a poſſeſſion of Right or Title, by which he

may lay claime unto them, which he may juſtly do.</p>
               <list>

                  <item>2. <hi>Jure pretii,</hi> for he hath laid down a price, and hath ranſomed, or purchaſed them by his death.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Jure donationis,</hi> for all of them are given unto him for ſubjection and rule.</item>
               </list>
               <p>2. <hi>Poſſeſſio Gratiae:</hi> A poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of grace, or a gracious poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, in which he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claime but take poſſeſſion, or enters a as poſſeſſor: of this I am now to ſpeak, and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends five things in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Sovereigne ſeazure,</hi> when he comes in as a poſſeſſour; he doth in a way of propriety ſet up his Title in the ſoul: As if he ſhould ſay, now this ſoul is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170259:100"/>
mine: It is no longer ſins, no longer the worlds, no longer the devils, no longer its own, but mine, and only mine, I am the Lord and husband of it. As in all contracts there reſults an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive propriety. <hi>Ezek. 16. 8. When I paſſed by thee, and looked upon thee, Behold, thy time was the time of love, and I ſpread my skirt over thee, yea, I ſware unto thee, and entred into a Covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> Or as <hi>Pſal. 132. 13. The Lord hath choſen Zion, he hath deſired it for his habitation.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>This is my reſt for ever, here will I dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence thoſe relative and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating expreſſions, as <hi>my love, my dove, my undefiled,</hi> Cant. 5. 2. As an husband can ſay, this woman is mine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The wife cannot be more the husbands, nor a houſe more the owners, nor a member more the heads, nor a branch more
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170259:100"/>
the vines then the opening ſoul is Chriſts.</p>
               <p>Which is therefore ſaid to be <hi>knit unto him,</hi> Epheſ. 4. and to be <hi>joyned,</hi> or <hi>glued unto him, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 17. and to be married <hi>unto him</hi> for an eternity, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And he is ſaid to own us as a Maſter owns a ſervant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. as an husband owns a wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, as a Lord owns an houſe, as the head owns the members, as the Lord once owned the Temple. So then Chriſt comes into the ſoule by way of poſſeſſion, when he doth intereſt himſelf in ſuch a peculiar way of union, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, that he ſaith, this ſoul is mine, and the ſoul may recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally anſwer, this Chriſt is mine, as the Church in <hi>Canticles</hi> 6. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A diſtinguiſhing furniture,</hi> when Chriſt takes poſſeſſion of a ſoul, there is not onely a <hi>relation of propriety,</hi> but there is alſo a <hi>communication of quality:</hi> The
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170259:101"/>
Spirit of Chriſt actuates. the whole ſoul with grace. As to make Chriſt (in himſelf a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour) there was not only the <hi>grace of union,</hi> by which he was God and man; but alſo the <hi>grace of unction,</hi> by which he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned and qualified to the work of Mediatour. So is it when Chriſt takes poſſeſſion of a poor ſoul, he doth apply himſelf to it, not onely in a way of <hi>affection,</hi> (wiſhing well to it) not only in a way of <hi>conſent</hi> (I do yeild my ſelf unto it) not only in a way of <hi>conſent</hi> (I do yeild my ſelf unto it) not only in a way of <hi>union</hi> (I take this ſoul as mine, and will own it as my own ſelf) not onely in a way of <hi>promiſe,</hi> (I will beſtow ſome good upon it) but alſo in a way of <hi>unction</hi> (that is) he doth ſet up himſelf in this his poſſeſſion; He doth <hi>qualifie,</hi> he doth <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> he doth <hi>beautifie</hi> every roome of the ſoul with the graces of his bleſſed Spirit: As when the <hi>Lord entred into the Temple</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> built, he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170259:101"/>
then <hi>filled the ſame with his glory,</hi> 1 King. 8. 11. So when Jeſus Chriſt enters into a ſoul, he fills that ſoul with the glory of his grace, with his <hi>influence</hi> as well as with his <hi>preſence.</hi> When the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> enters into us, he enters as a contagion, and as death; ſo when the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> enters into us, he enters into us as a renovation and life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Chriſt ſaid to <hi>be formed in us,</hi> Gal. 4. 19. The Papiſt talk of the figure of Chriſts body ſticking in the garments, &amp;c. that's a vanity, but this is a truth: that Chriſt doth forme himſelf in the ſoul of a beleever, he formes himſelf in us, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming us unto himſelf, implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us all holy graces, which 1. Alter. 2. Enable. 3. Diſpoſe and incline; as if he ſhould ſay, this heart ſhall love ſinne no more, it ſhall be enflamed with love to me; this heart ſhall truſt vanity no more, it ſhall truſt on
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170259:102"/>
me; this tongue ſhall blaſpheme no more, it ſhall praiſe me; this perſon ſhall be a ſlaye no more, he ſhall be a ſervant unto me. Behold (O ſoul) thou art become mine, and I muſt now adorne thee to be a delightful Manſion for my ſelf, therefore we are ſaid to be new creatures, and his workmanſhip, and to put on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Blindneſſe, vanity, folly, pride be gone: come in knowledge, wiſdom, ſoundneſſe of judgment, truth, regard of me and it; come in and poſſeſs the upper roome of this ſoul, the <hi>minde.</hi> Unwillingneſs, ſtoutneſs, rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hardneſs, hypocriſie be gone; come in plyableneſſe, ſoftneſſe, tenderneſs, ſincerity, readineſs, compliance with my will, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelf, come in and poſſeſs the royal chamber of the ſoul the <hi>will:</hi> Irregularity, vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inordinateneſſe be gone: Come in purity, order, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170259:102"/>
come in and poſſeſſe the lower roome of the ſoul, the affections. All ye graces of my Spirit, be ye ſet up in the inward rooms, and ſpread, and act in the outward rooms of the life, in all ſpiritualneſſe of behavior towards God and man, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A ſweet gubernation:</hi> for Chriſt poſſeſſeth the ſoul as a <hi>Lord</hi> poſſeſſeth his Manſion, to do what he pleaſeth, and to rule after his own will in it: and therefore he is called <hi>the Lord of his Temple:</hi> And <hi>the houſholder,</hi> who employs and ſets every ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant his work, having firſt given unto them ſeveral talents. He muſt have and hath the command and diſpoſal of the ſoul. As the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> ſaid, <hi>to one ſervant go, and he went, do this, and he did it, come and he came,</hi> Matth. 8. So ſaith Chriſt to the ſoule which he takes poſſeſſion of; I will have you ſometimes to abound, and then you muſt be thankful,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170259:103"/>
and ſometimes to want, and then you muſt be contented: now I will have you to do for me with your graces, or with your eſtates, and you muſt then be ready to do: and another time, now I will have you to ſuffer for me in your Name, in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, in your poſſeſſions, in your liberties, perhaps in your lives, and you muſt then be willing to forſake all for me. Sometimes your luſts will be commanding, but do not hearken to them; ſometimes Satan will be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but do not yeild to him; ſometimes your carnal friends will be trying of you, but do not regard them; you are none of theirs, nor none of your own; you are my poſſeſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be only at my diſpoſal.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A watchful proviſion,</hi> when a man takes poſſeſſion of houſe, or houſhold, or lands, he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon engaged to take care and charge over all: He muſt Till the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170259:103"/>
ground, and manure it, and mend it, and keep it in heart; and he muſt keep and repaire the houſe, if it be ſinking, and he muſt maintaine the ſervants with all neceſſaries of food and rayment; he muſt look to them when they be well, and when they be ſick; juſt ſo doth Chriſt, when he takes poſſeſſion of a ſoule, he takes upon him the full care of that ſoul, he will be a ſufficiency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it,</p>
               <p>By <hi>preſerving the graces</hi> given unto it.</p>
               <p>By <hi>adding ſutable degrees,</hi> and helps of grace for greater and further ſervices.</p>
               <p>By <hi>repairing and recovering</hi> a fallen or ſinking ſoul. There is a rich ſtore-houſe in Chriſt, for the ſoul which he poſſeſſeth: He will give renuing grace, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace, and then he will keep that grace given; And he will yet adde more grace and help.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:170259:104"/>And if the ſoul be drawn aſide, and falls, he will not loſe it, he will ſeek after it, he will find it again, and recover it again.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A ſure protection:</hi> when one hath poſſeſſion, it behoves him to keep poſſeſſion, he is to defray all the rents or dues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that poſſeſſion is charged; and he is to anſwer and take off all claimes and titles made againſt his right of poſſeſſion. Go to my Maſter, ſaith the ſervant; to my husband, ſaith the wife; So doth Jeſus Chriſt, when he enters and takes poſſeſſion of the ſoul. This ſoul (ſaith Chriſt) is mine, I own it, I will provide for it; plead for it or againſt it who will or can, I will anſwer him, I will anſwer for it, I will ſtand 'twixt it &amp; all pleas, 'twixt it and all claims 'twixt it and all hazards, I will, take all upon me, and as long as I am Chriſt, and as far as my blood will go, or my interceſſion will go, or my merits can go, or my
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170259:104"/>
Spirit can go, I will maintain and defend mine own.</p>
               <p>John 17. 12. <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt.</hi>

               <p>Rom. 8. 34. <hi>Who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth? It is Chriſt that died, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, come who will, and do your utmoſt, yet I will be poſſeſſour and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſtill. <hi>Satan</hi> ſtands out, and ſaith, this ſoul belongs to me, I have had poſſeſſion of it a long time; too long, ſaith Chriſt, a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170259:105"/>
deceiver and uſurper as thou art, but I have cruſhed and bruiſed thy power; Come thou out and never enter into this ſoule more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sinne</hi> ſtands out, and ſaith, this ſoul hath been my habitation from the firſt, but Chriſt <hi>caſts out the bond-woman with her childe,</hi> and ſaith, thy poſſeſſion is but an incroachment: This ſoul was mine by <hi>Creation</hi> firſt of all, and now is mine againe by <hi>purchaſe,</hi> and therefore ſin get you gone, Never ſhalt thou have royal poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in any ſoul that belongs to me. And when the ſoul ſometimes reports ſad tydings, that divine juſtice calls upon it for arreara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, well, ſaith Chriſt, let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; I was thy ſurety, all is diſcharg'd, I have ſatisfied all: I am thy <hi>propitiation,</hi> feare thou not, all is well 'twixt thee and my Father, <hi>I am his beloved Sonne, in whom he is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:170259:105"/>So that (ſummarily) then Chriſt doth come in and take poſſeſſion of the ſoul, when he doth unite himſelf to the ſoul, or ſeazeth on it as his own, and then purifies and enables it for his ſervice and uſe, and then erects his power and rule in it and over it, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes for it, for full proviſions and protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What the <hi>properties</hi> &amp; <hi>adjuncts</hi> of this poſſeſſion are?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The <hi>poſſeſſing is real:</hi> it is not a fixious notion formed only by a wild imagination, for the doore of the heart is a real thing, and the knocking at the door is a real motion and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and the opening of the door is a real dilatation of the ſoul to embrace Chriſt; ſo likewiſe is his coming in, it is a real entrance and taking poſſeſſion of the ſoul, a real owning and intereſſing, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2 Yet it is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> you muſt not be ſo weak to imagine that the perſon of Chriſt comes now
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170259:106"/>
into our hearts, as once into ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners houſes, O no, a corporal poſſeſſion cannot be, and it alone were fruitleſſe. But Chriſt takes poſſeſſion of the ſoul, <hi>(being a ſpirit)</hi> by his Spirit; and therefore as in one place <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to <hi>dwell in us,</hi> Eph. 3. 17. ſo in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place the <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſaid to <hi>dwell in us,</hi> John 14. 17. and as <hi>he is ſaid to be in us,</hi> ſo <hi>his Spirit is ſaid to be in us: He dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you,</hi> ibid. It is his Spirit which applies him to us, and it is his Spirit which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us (by way of efficiency) the graces we enjoy, and it is the Spirit of Chriſt who ruleth in us, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. It is <hi>powerful;</hi> all that Chriſt doth about the ſoul, either for entrance or maintenance, is carried with exceeding power when he is taking poſſeſſion, he doth diſpoſſeſſe the <hi>ſtrong man in the houſe,</hi> and with a greater ſtrength of power reſcues and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170259:106"/>
delivers; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were brought out of the <hi>houſe of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> by an Almighty arme: When he poſſeſſeth the ſoul, (poſſeſſed by himſelfe) with his grace, he communicates theſe by an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power; no power leſſe then <hi>Almightineſſe,</hi> leſs then that which raiſed Chriſt from the dead, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to quicken a dead ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>preſervation of grace received</hi> is likewiſe a work of power: The ſame Sunne which begets the light muſt preſerve the light: <hi>We are kept by the power of God unto ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. It is <hi>eternal:</hi> till you can quench the love of Chriſt, till you can reverſe the ſeals of Chriſt, till you can cruſh the power of Chriſt, (which never can be done) Chriſt who hath taken poſſeſſion will keep it. If you had poſſeſſion of Chriſt, and Chriſt had no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of you, then ſome danger, but ye hold Chriſt, and Chriſt holds you, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:170259:107"/>
                  <hi>Queſt. 3. Why Chriſt enters and takes poſſeſſion, and will dwell in any ſoul that opens to him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have his <hi>promiſe</hi> for it in the text, and Chriſt was never yet worſe then his word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He will not be <hi>behinde hand in his goodneſſe to any:</hi> If he offers himſelf when the door is ſhut, he will not ſtand off when the door is opened. If he purſues us fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he will not ſhun us yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if he allures us whiles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, he will ſurely embrace us being willing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is himſelf who makes the heart willing to open,</hi> and for this end, that himſelf might enter: There is no more required on our parts; I am willing ſaith Chriſt to enter, are you willing to let me in? If your will concurs with him, the work is done: nothing but the ſinners unwillingneſs hath kept him out all this while.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When the <hi>heart comes to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:170259:107"/>
it is now <hi>ſufficiently condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned</hi> and <hi>fitted for all that Chriſt intends to work in it:</hi> For,</p>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>When the ſoul comes to open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing termes, it ſtands in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt need of Christ:</hi> Never did a wounded, gored body ſtand in more need of plaiſters, nor a diſeaſed body ſtand in more need of medicines, nor a tortured bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtand in more need of eaſe, nor a ſtarved hungry body ſtand in more need of bread, nor a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued body ſtand in more need of help, nor an accuſed body ſtand in more need of defence, nor a fainting body ſtand in more need of cordials, then the humbled and

                  <hi>Life</hi> is come into my body, and <hi>ſin</hi> is come into my ſoul, and the <hi>Law</hi> is come into my conſcience, and the <hi>Gospel</hi> is come unto my ear: and <hi>ſtrivings</hi> are come into my Spirit, and <hi>honours</hi> are come upon my Name, and riches are come upon my Trade, and <hi>friends</hi> are come in to my ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not yet come into my houſe.</p>

I thought my ſelf to be Chriſts poſſeſſion, but was deceived, and now am hells portion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, how may one know that Chriſt is
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170259:109"/>
come, and hath taken poſſeſſion of the ſoul indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It may be evidenced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his affecting excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By his virtual efficacy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By his exciting authority.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By our importuning inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by his <hi>affecting excellency:</hi> O ſirs, before Chriſt comes in, much of the excellency of Chriſt appeared to the ſoul by way of invitation, but when he is come to the ſoul, more of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency now appears by way of fruition: <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> may much affect us, but fruition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth much more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us: Now the ſoul ſees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a wonderful Redeemer, a wonderful love, a wonderful ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, a wonderful happineſs. As the <hi>Queen of Sheba,</hi> when ſhe ſaw <hi>Solomon</hi> in his glory, her ſpirit failed; or as <hi>Simeon,</hi> when he <hi>got Chriſt in his armes, Now
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170259:110"/>
let me depart, mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation;</hi> or as <hi>Jacob</hi> when he ſaw <hi>Joſeph, now let me die;</hi> or as <hi>David, return to thy reſt O my ſoul, for, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 116.</p>
               <p>The ſoul which is poſſeſſed of Chriſt, adores, admires, cries out, I am ſatisfied, I have enough; the pearl is found, the chiefeſt of ten thouſand is mine: As the Sun darkens all the Stars; all is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Chriſt: Now I have love, joy, friends, lands and al in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This is the Chriſt that I looked for, that I longed for; I ſee, and finde in him the great love of God; the exact beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ull redemption; God reconciled; a ſpring of life; worth to ſatisfie judgement; worthineſs to fatisfie my will; ſweetneſſe to ſatisfie my affections; happineſs to ſatisfie my whole ſoul; now I am abundantly payed for all my prayers, pains, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by his <hi>virtual efficacy:</hi> Chriſt is not an empty notion, but
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170259:110"/>
a quick agent: and when he comes into a ſoul, vertue from him comes into the ſoul too: Chriſt and his Spirit come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and dwell together, <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his.</hi> In <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. you <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 9.</note> read a promiſe of his coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a prepared ſoul. <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. And then of the work which he doth when he is come <hi>(He ſhall ſit as a refiner and purifier of ſilver.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A refiner or purifier uſeth the fire to melt the mettal, and to ſeparate the droſſe and ruſt from it, and ſo makes it pure, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and uſeful.</p>
               <p>The ſoul of a man is a corrupt veſſel, and when Chriſt comes in to it, he doth by his Spirit, (which is compared to fire) cleanſe and purifie it, make it holy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, and ſerviceable, ſtamps his own image upon it: Now you ſhall be able to love your God, to hate your ſinne, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the world, to pray,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170259:111"/>
to mourn, to truſt, to wait, to be meek, lowly, contemned, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. By his <hi>exceeding authority:</hi> when Chriſt takes poſſeſſion, he doth immediately ſet up his Throne, and rule in the heart: He rules all, and rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and the ſoul is willingly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediential. He pulls down all authority contrary to himſelf: as that <hi>laſt Monarchy in Daniel</hi> cruſhed all the reſt.</p>
               <p>He hath poſſeſſion who hath an acknowledged and conſented do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over your ſouls; <hi>His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ye are whom ye obey,</hi> Rom. 6. O how doth this diſcover mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to be none of Chriſts poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion? Some they will not have him to rule at all: Others like the <hi>Mother</hi> about the childe, <hi>let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it;</hi> a ſinful luſt muſt rule, and a worldly luſt ſhall rule, and Chriſt (if he pleaſe) ſhall then rule too; but would you be half ſaved? ſurely where Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170259:111"/>
takes poſſeſſion, Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is ſet up, and the whole ſoule comes freely under ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt,</hi> ſaid the Martyr: I will know none but Chriſt, love none but Chriſt, ſerve none but Chriſt; the will of a beleever comes up to the will of its Saviour.</p>
               <p>4. By our <hi>importunate inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;</hi> If Chriſt hath taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ſoul, that ſoul would have more poſſeſſion of Chriſt: O I have not yet attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I have not yet enough of Chriſt. O ſaith <hi>Paul, that I may apprehend as I am apprehended,</hi> Phil. 3. Such a ſoul would have all to fall into the hands of Chriſt, and to be more and more poſſeſſed by Chriſt: Lord, here's yet much ignorance, O poſſeſſe my minde more with thy <hi>light.</hi> Lord, here are <hi>many doubts and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If upon ſearch any of you do diſcerne Chriſts poſſeſſing preſence, riſe up and <hi>bleſſe God,</hi> go home and <hi>rejoyce in your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> It was a great matter for Chriſt to come into a mans houſe: It is more for him to come into a mans heart.</p>

                  </gap>ation and Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>All the promiſes of God are Yea and Amen in Chriſt</hi> (that is) they are to be fulfilled and made good to beleevers: I ſay all the promiſes which are rich veines, and full veines, the ſtore-houſes of all mercy, and grace, and good; Theſe are to be made good unto us by Chriſt: Not onely in a way of <hi>ſtability,</hi> but
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170259:127"/>
likewiſe in a way of efficacy which could never be without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the good things promiſed unto beleevers; Chriſt hath the key of all theſe in his hands.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore are in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he is the Maſter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe them to his family, the houſhold of faith.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is filled with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in himſelf, and with love alſo to his members who are beleevers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although all goodneſſe <hi>(ex natura rei)</hi> be deffuſive of it ſelf, yet is it moſt communicating when either it is ſeated in a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or engraven in an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A good father will impart more good then a good man; a loving husband will do more good then a meere husband: The goodneſſe in Chriſt is a goodneſſe both wayes: It is a <hi>goodneſſe in relation,</hi> (that is) in one who ſtands to beleevers as an head doth to its members; and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170259:127"/>
a <hi>goodneſs in affection,</hi> (that is) in one who loves beleevers above all the people in the world; and certainly love is bountiful: it is an eaſie key to open, and a liberal hand to beſtow.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>What ſhould Chriſt do with himſelf, and with all his benefits?</hi> God at the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented not himſelf (if I may ſo ſpeak) with himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore created man to communicate ſome of his goodneſſe to him. And when Chriſt redeemed man, he contents not himſelf with the perfecting of the work of redemption, but he muſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the vertue and fruit of it unto men; unleſſe we will ſay he lived in vaine, or died in vaine, or roſe in vaine; he died not for himſelf, nor roſe for himſelf.</p>
               <p>But who ſhall partake of this purchaſed good? ſhall enemies, or friends? ſhall they enjoy it who will not enjoy him? ſhall they enjoy ſweetneſſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170259:128"/>
who ſhut their doors and hearts againſt him, and abhor the union of his perſon? O no, we cannot ſup together if we will not come together. But as he wrote upon his book, <hi>mihi &amp; meis</hi> this book is for me and for my friends, or as we write in our Leaſes, for us and our heirs; ſo ſaith Chriſt of all his goodneſſe, this is for me and my members; this is for me and beleevers; I may look on others, but I will live with them; I may ſpeak to others, but I will ſup with them; others may have a call from me, but theſe onely ſhall have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with me.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Beleevers have much work lying upon them for Chriſt,</hi> active and paſſive, ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, none of which can be done without communication from Chriſt. <hi>Chriſts works</hi> and <hi>Chriſts help are paralel:</hi> The hand can do nothing for the head, but by an influence imparted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170259:128"/>
to it from the head; <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> John 15. 5.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>All the good we do is done by the strength of communion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>On Chriſts part it is the Spirit,</hi> which is compared to fire and water (that are diffuſive and ſpreading) and to <hi>oyntment</hi> (the unction of the Spirit) which ſpreds its ſavour, and to light which is diffuſive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On our part it is faith:</hi> and faith is a,</p>

All in this life is but as the firſt fruits, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt is to come but as the earneſt penny, the full reward is to come; but as the contract, the marriage is to come.</p>

               <p>Chriſt will let out his ſtrength of holineſſe and glory upon you, and you ſhall let out the ſtrength of love to Chriſt, you ſhall enjoy him to the utmoſt capacity of fruition, and you ſhall love him with the utmoſt poſſibility of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for ever and ever.

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> O friend, let that little be never ſo little, if it be <hi>aliquid Chriſti,</hi> it is great in worth, though ſmall in bulk. A little iſſuing from communion with him is the fruit of higheſt love, and the pledge of fulleſt glory. The ring of gold is little, but it with a pearle is very much: A little grace with a full Chriſt is a condition very high: If the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian were truly humble and wiſe who had the prizing of it; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is little which drops from Chriſt; the leaſt ray of gold is precious.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Where Chriſt communicates a little, there he will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate more, 'tis a gift, not a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There are ſhowers which guſh out of a cloud, but they quickly ceaſe, they grow leſſe and leſſe: There are drops which diſtil out of a fountaine, and they ſtill increaſe: Thou haſt no ſooner received one degree of grace, but Chriſt is ready to adde another. Methinks the child ſhould ſuck quietly, when, although it takes not in the whole breaſt at once, yet the milk is ſpinning out to renue a further drought after the former is gone down.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt imparts not alike to all, nor all at once to any: He ſo gives, as that ſtill he reſerves more to give: I feare our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not be ſure, were there not ſome good ſtill in Chriſts hand to beſtow, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170259:138"/>
would ceaſe if communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did ceaſe.</p>
               <p>It is an unſpeakable comfort to me, that Chriſt is mine, no man ever enjoyed him, but he ſhall enjoy more from him: I bleſſe his goodneſſe for the former, I will wait on his wiſdom for the latter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Live like thoſe who have communion with Chriſt: Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> ſaw in a dreame <hi>an image whoſe head was of gold,</hi> but the <hi>feet were part of iron, and part of clay,</hi> Dan. 2. 32. 33. Truly that Chriſtian is but in a dreame who fancies a golden communion, and yet wallows in a wicked converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>If we ſay that we have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſſe, we lie, 1 John</hi> 1. 6. The forty four thouſand with the Lamb had his Fathers name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their foreheads.</p>
               <p>In communion there is alwayes ſimilitude and conformity, and this is twofold in a Chriſtian
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170259:139"/>
to that in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of <hi>holineſſe:</hi> when the grace of Chriſt appears but <hi>doctrinally,</hi> it <hi>teaches us to live holily,</hi> Titus 2. 12. much more when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>effectually</hi> in communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Chriſt. Surely they are much miſtaken who can <hi>exalt the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>deſpiſe the Law;</hi> who can magnifie the <hi>merit of Chriſt,</hi> and withal contemn the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> As if a good Chriſt and a good life were inconſiſtent, or as if the blood of Chriſt purchaſed this unhappy favour for us to live licentiouſly: will you ſhame your head and deny that Chriſt that bought you? Is this a Chriſt communication? Is this to <hi>ſhew the vertues of him who hath called you?</hi> Brethren, <hi>be not deceived, God is not mocked:</hi> An evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is incomplyable with the <hi>learning of Chriſt in truth,</hi> Eph. 4. 21, 22. <hi>For what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, or what communion hath
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170259:139"/>
light with darkneſſe, and what concord hath Chriſt with Belial? and what agreement hath the Temple of God with idols?</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 16, 17. Some would recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile our Religion and Popery; and you would reconcile heaven and hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Of communicativeneſſe:</hi> all the good which Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts to us, is for to make us good, and for to enable us to do good: If you kindle a fire, it is to give warmth; If you give your ſteward money, it is to lay it out: All the ſtarres (they ſay) have light from the Sunne, but then their light imparts it ſelf againe by influence to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſub-celeſtial, you muſt do more then others. Thou haſt received <hi>knowledge</hi> from Chriſt, this candle ſhould give light to others, as well as to thy ſelfe.

               <p>Chriſt hath ſhewed pity to thee, ſurely it is, that thou ſhouldeſt ſhew pity to others: He <hi>forgives thee,</hi> ſhouldeſt not thou forgive thy brother? when you were wandering, he ſought after you; when you were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, he inſtructed you; when you were untoward, he yet bare with you; when you humbled your ſoules, he cheered you; when you yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, he preſently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced you; O how often hath he bound up your wounded ſoules? How often hath he raiſed up your fallen feet, you have lived upon his blood, upon his Spirit, upon his love, upon his bounty all your dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:170259:141"/>
                  <hi>Let the ſame minde be in you which is in your Chriſt.</hi> O when ſhall the ſoule of a childe, of a wife, of a ſervant, of a friend, of a neighbour, cry out, and ſay, I bleſſe God for ſuch a Father, for ſuch a Husband, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Improve your communion with Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 4. 14. ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we have a <hi>great High Prieſt,</hi> verſe 16. <hi>Let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtaine mercy, and finde grace to help in time of need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sirs, there is a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ſoul, one is of <hi>diſtance,</hi> I never found a Chriſt; O then be wiſe to ſtrive to get him.</p>
               <p>The other is of <hi>preſence,</hi> I enjoy a Chriſt, O then be wiſe to make uſe of him; When I want bread, then I muſt look out for it, when I poſſeſſe bread, then I muſt feed on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:170259:142"/>Conſider three things to ſet on this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though your <hi>relation be excellent,</hi> yet your <hi>condition is indigent.</hi> No Chriſtian hath ſo little of Chriſt, but he hath mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for praiſe: And no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an hath ſo much from Chriſt, but he hath matter ſtill left for prayer. Every day we finde it a great work to do a little work, much patience to beare a little croſſe, much ſtrength to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer a little temptation, much faith to anſwer one doubt, much love to eat out one luſt, much zeal to act one piece of ſervice. As our receits are more then our deſarts, ſo our wants are much larger then our receits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a fulneſſe in Chriſt,</hi> and that with reſpect to your wants; compare any part of good in him with any part of want in your ſelves, it hath in it three qualities.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sutableneſs:</hi> Mercy to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170259:142"/>
miſery, Holineſſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſinne, Peace to anſwer trouble, ſtrength to anſwer weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Fulneſſe: remiſſion of ſinnes</hi> lies in his blood as in a perfect merit and diſcharge: <hi>Holineſs</hi> lies in his natures as an original and infinite ſpring.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Willingneſſe to impart this to you;</hi> I know the great ſcruple ſtill lies about this, but in truth the imparting will of Chriſt is unutterable; can love, invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, union, donations aſſure you of this, he bids us come and eat abundantly.</p>
               <p>I will not expatiate in this, onely if you conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That gracious deſigne in God to draw up ſome to a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and eternal communion with himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The voluntary contract 'twixt him and Chriſt to effect this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All that for which Chriſt
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170259:143"/>
engageth himſelf to beleevers as well as unto God his and their Father.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All his coſt already upon them which would be loſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further communicating; you muſt confeſſe his wonderful willingneſſe, unleſſe you would imagine that either God ſhould miſſe of his deſigne, or Chriſt is willing to loſe all his pains.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>You your ſelves have all the kindes of improving of Chriſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending you:</hi> For you have,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Improving intereſts, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and <hi>communion,</hi> he is yours, and therefore will do you good: He hath done you good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will do you more good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Improving principles: Faith</hi> and <hi>love:</hi> He is the fountaine, and faith is the veſſel, given purpoſely unto you ſtill to draw out of his fulneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Improving Ordinances,</hi> the <hi>word and Sacrament:</hi> They are bread ſet out on purpoſe to feed
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170259:143"/>
you: They are the armes of Chriſt ſpread on purpoſe to ſtrengthen you; they are the pipes of Chriſt, laid out on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to convey more of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
               <p>Therefore O thou feeble and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining ſoul, who haſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt; conſider thy ſelfe and thy condition often; and ſay, what need I yet from Chriſt? wherein do I fall ſhort? what is it that I want? what may Chriſt yet do for me?</p>
               <p>And then ſtirre up faith to act in Chriſt, to go to Chriſt, to beg of Chriſt, to draw from Chriſt more faith, more love, more humility, more patience, more fruitfulneſſe, more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, more ſtrength, more aſſurance, more joy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Say thus, a friend will do for a friend; an husband will do for his wife; an head will do for a member: A Chriſt, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170259:144"/>
a Chriſt will do for a beleever. If he gives himſelf, he will give all other things; if he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his blood for me already: if he will give me glory hereafter, ſurely he will give me a dramme of grace more, and a drop of comfort more.</p>

                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:170259:145"/>Four things ever precede the ſtate of communion.</p>

And truly ſo it is in this communion, Chriſt and the ſoule are drawn ſo neer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they ſeeme to be but one ſoule; Chriſt lives in the ſoule, and the ſoule lives in Chriſt: As they report of the heart of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Name of Jeſus was engraven upon it: ſure I am, the nature and power of Chriſt are engraven upon the hearts of them who have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him.</p>

               <p>A deluded Chriſtian is never

in the ſoul with greater deſire of more communion with him.

               <p>There is a vaſt difference 'twixt a deſigne which a perſon hath upon Chriſt, and a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> which one hath with Chriſt. <hi>A deſigne on Chriſt is a mercenary complying with Chriſt for ſome particular good,</hi> and this being obtained, that perſon hath enough of Chriſt: If I meet with a commodity in the market, I have that which I looked for, and ſo wholly quit the Market; If I have an arme bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I ſend for the Chirurgion,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170259:151"/>
and he ſets the bone, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſed, I have no further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him. And ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a perſon, he would have a protection from hell by Chriſt, and then he is ſatisfied; he would have his tormenting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience alayd by Chriſt, and then he hath done with Chriſt: But in communion with Chriſt that ſoul is fixed on Chriſt; for Chriſt as my univerſal good, and therefore riſeth ſtill more and more after Chriſt: <hi>Lord, evermore give us this bread:</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very receipt from Chriſt begets an higher degree of love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire unto Chriſt: as every drop of oyle addes more light and life (as it were) to the Lamp.

               </p>
               <p>Three things makes up this mans ſad condition.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>All the good in Chriſt is ſealed from him:</hi> It is to him as if Chriſt had never lived, and never died for ſinners: His condition is much like that of the damned devils, who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſinners, and eternal ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: Thus it is with him, his communion is ever with ſinne, but never, never ſhall it be with Chriſt.</p>
